# COS 202 PROJECT
# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME

This is a colorful beginner-friendly version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game created using Java. The game is designed to be fun, lively, and easy to play.
The game has the following features:
1. A playful welcome page with bright colors and fun fonts where players can choose to start the game or quit.
2. A simple screen where both players enter their names (Player 1 will use X and Player 2 will use O).
3. A 3x3 grid of colorful buttons where players take turns clicking to place their X or O. The game keeps track of moves and displays whose turn it is.
4. After someone wins or if the game ends in a draw, a bright, celebratory screen appears with the result. Players can choose to play again or return to the ID screen to start fresh or quit.
